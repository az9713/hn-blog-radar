  > It's unclear why they'd launch without doing that, since it entirely defeats the point of using HSMs)  When Twitter[1] launched encrypted DMs a couple  of years ago, it was the worst kind of end-to-end  encrypted -  technically  e2ee, but in a way that made it relatively easy for Twitter to inject new encryption keys and get everyone's messages anyway. **It was also lacking a whole bunch of features such as "sending pictures", so the entire thing was largely a waste of time.** But a couple of days ago, Elon  announced  the arrival of "XChat", a new encrypted message platform  built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture .
