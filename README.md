# HN Blog Intelligence

Turns an OPML feed list into ranked, validated project ideas — by extracting developer pain signals from 92 Hacker News tech blogs, scoring them by trend momentum, authority, and breadth, then clustering related signals into actionable ideas.

All code, tests, and documentation were generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) powered by Claude Opus 4.6.

## How It Works

The tool reads 92 curated tech blog RSS feeds, extracts pain-point language from posts, and clusters related signals into ranked project ideas.

**1. Fetch** — Downloads posts from 92 RSS feeds into a local SQLite database.

**2. Extract** — Scans post content for six types of pain signals:
- **Wish**: "I wish there was...", "someone should build..."
- **Frustration**: "frustrating", "drives me crazy"
- **Gap**: "no good tool for...", "missing", "lacking"
- **Difficulty**: "hard to...", "struggle with..."
- **Broken**: "buggy", "unreliable", "constantly breaks"
- **Opportunity**: "ripe for disruption", "room for..."

**3. Score** — Each signal is scored by a composite of trend momentum (0.35), blog authority (0.25), breadth across blogs (0.25), and recency (0.15). Posts older than 12 months are excluded.

**4. Cluster** — Related signals are grouped into coherent themes using TF-IDF vectorization and agglomerative clustering.

**5. Label & Rank** — Each idea gets a descriptive label (e.g., "Simplified Database Migration", "Reliable DNS Resolution") and is ranked by impact score. Only ideas validated across 2+ independent blogs are kept.

## Data Source

The blog feed list (`docs/hn-blogs.opml`) is sourced from [hn-popular-blogs-2025.opml](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/emschwartz/e6d2bf860ccc367fe37ff953ba6de66b/raw/426957f043dc0054f95aae6c19de1d0b4ecc2bb2/hn-popular-blogs-2025.opml), a curated collection of 92 RSS feeds from the most popular blogs on Hacker News, compiled by [Evan Schwartz](https://gist.github.com/emschwartz).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Fetch blog posts (~2 minutes)
hn-intel fetch

# Surface project ideas (printed to terminal)
hn-intel ideas

# Save ideas to files
hn-intel ideas --output-dir output
```

After running the last command, open `output/ideas.md` for the full report with justifications, source attribution, and evidence quotes from the original blog posts.

## Example Output

```
Surfacing project ideas...
Found 15 project ideas:

  1. Simplified Database Migration
     Impact: 0.72 | Blogs: 4 | Signals: 7
     "It is hard to run zero-downtime database migrations...."
     Sources:
       - simonwillison.net: https://simonwillison.net/2026/...
       - xeiaso.net: https://xeiaso.net/blog/...
       - fasterthanli.me: https://fasterthanli.me/articles/...

  2. Reliable DNS Resolution
     Impact: 0.65 | Blogs: 3 | Signals: 5
     "DNS caching in containers is broken in many orchestrators...."
     Sources:
       - mitchellh.com: https://mitchellh.com/writing/...
       - matklad.github.io: https://matklad.github.io/2025/...
       - fasterthanli.me: https://fasterthanli.me/articles/...

  ...
```

Each idea in `ideas.md` includes:
- **Impact score** — composite of trend momentum, blog authority, breadth, and recency
- **Justification** — why this idea has high impact
- **Evidence** — grouped by source post, with pain type and context quotes
- **Pain type breakdown** — distribution across the six signal categories

## CLI Reference

### `hn-intel fetch`

Fetch RSS feeds and populate the database.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--opml` | `docs/hn-blogs.opml` | Path to OPML file containing feed URLs |
| `--timeout` | `30` | HTTP request timeout in seconds |
| `--delay` | `0.5` | Delay between feed requests (rate limiting) |

```bash
hn-intel fetch
hn-intel fetch --timeout 60 --delay 1.0
```

### `hn-intel status`

Display database statistics (blog count, post count, last fetch time). No options.

```bash
hn-intel status
```

### `hn-intel ideas`

Surface project ideas from blog pain signals.

| Option | Default | Description |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `pip: command not found` | Try `python -m pip --version`. Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH". |
| `hn-intel: command not found` | Activate virtual environment first (`.venv\Scripts\activate`). |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hn_intel'` | Activate venv and run `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. |
| All feeds fail (`Feeds errored: 92`) | Check internet connection. Try `hn-intel fetch --timeout 120`. |
| `New posts: 0` | Posts already fetched. Run `hn-intel status` to check. Delete `data/hn_intel.db` to re-fetch. |
| `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` | Close other `hn-intel` processes. |
